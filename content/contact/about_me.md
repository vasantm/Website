I am native of Bombay (now called Mumbai), India. I did my undergraduate studies at [Ramnarain Ruia College](https://www.ruiacollege.edu) studying Statistics and Operations Research. After which I did post graduate course in Information Technology at Univ. of Mumbai. Just before graduating from college is around when, I decided to study Bioinformatics and decided to come to the US to pursue a Masters. I went to [Marquette and the Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.marquette.edu/grad/programs-bioinformatics.php) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Yes, that was quite the change to go from a bustling city by the sea to small city on the shores of Lake Michigan with great beer and friendly people.

After finishing up my Masters, I worked at the Kristal Lab, Dementia Research Service, [Burke Medical Research Institute](https://burke.weill.cornell.edu/), a neurological research institute affiliated with Cornell Med. School in White Plains, NY.

I moved to Boston in 2007 as the Kristal Lab moved to Harvard/Brigham and Women's Hospital. Our lab was initially  part of the Dept. of Neurosurgery and since 2016 we're part of the [Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/sleep-and-circadian-disorders/overview), within the Dept. of Medicine. 

When not working at my desk or computer munging data, producing graphs and writing R code I like to cook, take [photos](/photos/index.html) and get the occasional hike in.
