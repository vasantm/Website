I am a Bioinformatician at the Kristal Lab, Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Dept. of Medicine at the [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/sleep-and-circadian-disorders/overview) in Boston, Mass. I am currently working on finding markers of circadian time using lipidomics.
