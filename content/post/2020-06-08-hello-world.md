It's been a while, since I have had an active website or a blog. I used to blog more frequently, maybe about a decade back and also did some photoblogging. Work and the thing called life got in the way of posting regularly, I hope to make blogging a habit in the years ahead.

Most posts will be technical, focussing on R, data science, bioinformatics, data management, interspersed with some personal stories and the occasional photograph that you can find at [Photos.](/photos/index.html)
